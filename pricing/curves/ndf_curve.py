"""
NDF-implied COP discount curve builder.

Bootstraps a COP discount curve from market-observed USD/COP forward rates.
This captures the NDF market basis (credit, convertibility risk, supply/demand)
that interest rate parity misses.

From interest rate parity:
  F(T) = Spot × DF_USD(T) / DF_COP(T)

Given market forwards F(T), spot S, and the SOFR curve (DF_USD), we solve:
  DF_COP(T) = Spot × DF_USD(T) / F(T)

These discount factors are assembled into a ql.DiscountCurve with
log-linear interpolation.

This curve should be used for NDF pricing instead of the IBR curve.
The IBR curve remains correct for IBR swaps.

Data source: cop_fwd_points table (FXEmpire collector)
  - Tenors: 1M through 10Y (market-observed forward points)
  - fwd_points column: pip differential relative to spot
  - Outright forward reconstructed as: spot (SET-ICAP) + fwd_points (FXEmpire)
  - Using SET-ICAP spot ensures the outright forward is anchored to the
    authoritative Colombian interbank fixing, not FXEmpire's embedded spot.
